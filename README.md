=> With the help of this idea we can easily manage the hostlers day to day problems like their cleanliness, electricity, mess food problems can be easily registered
=> We can get it undertaken by the concerned workers and best thing is that now there is no need to visit the warden room each time to register our complains because here easily
=> each student will be given the access to register it and all the concerned workers employed for that can easily know about it by just login their passwords each time.
=> Here the hostel chiefs can easily know about the status of complains at a one click of just a password even the deans can also investigate it easily.
